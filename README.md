Dice Poker:- Poker is a popular card game where the goal is to beat the dealer (and other players) by having the hand which out ranks all other hands. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker Typically, each player is dealt five playing cards called a hand. Each hand is then compared against the other players in order to determine the winning hand, that is, the hand that out ranks the other hands. Each hand has a rank and is ranked according to the rules of poker: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands. This card game translates well into a dice game. Instead of a deck of 52 cards, you will use five, six sided dice in order to play the game.
